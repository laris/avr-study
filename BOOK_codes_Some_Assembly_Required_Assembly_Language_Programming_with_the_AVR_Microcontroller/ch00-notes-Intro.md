  - communicating with or controlling peripheral devices

* Machine language instructions are 
  - simply binary codes that 
  - are interpreted by the proces- sorâ€™s hardware and 
  - converted to a sequence of electrical signals that 
  - alter the state of the computer system

* The Instruction Set Architecture of a processor 
  - includes its instruction set and 
  - the system components the instructions directly or indirectly affect. 
    - These components include 
    - registers, 
    - memory,
