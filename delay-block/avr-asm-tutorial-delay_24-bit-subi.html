<h1>Time loops with 24 bit and more registers in AVR assembler based on SUBI</h1>
The following describes a different timing loop with 24 bits. This demonstrates that the same
task can be solved with very different means in assembler. This solution here is shorter, easier
to understand and simpler to calculate as the previous one. The code is then expanded to 64 bits.
<br><br>
The source code of the delay loop is like this:
<pre>
<code>
.equ c = 12345 ; A constant for counting down
;
.def rC1 = R16 ; Three registers to count down
.def rC2 = R17 ; The second one
.def rC3 = R18 ; The third one
;
Main: ; The main code starts here
  sbi DDRB,PORTB0 ; Make PB0 an output
RestartCount: ; The counter loop starts here
  ldi rC1,Byte1(c-1) ; Load LSB of the counter value
  ldi rC2,Byte2(c-1) ; Load middle of the counter value
  ldi rC3,Byte3(c-1) ; Load MSB of the counter value
CountDown:
  subi rC1,1 ; Sets the carry flag if previously zero
  brcc CountDown ; If not yet carry continue couting
  subi rC2,1 ; Downcount the middle byte
  brcc CountDown ; If not yet carry count on
  subi rC3,1 ; Downcount the MSB byte
  brcc CountDown ; If not yet carry count on
  sbi PINB,PINB0 ; Toggle PB0 state
  rjmp RestartCount ; Start new count cycle
</code>
</pre>
The SUBI instruction sets the carry flag when the subtraction
underflows from zero to 0xFF. This is the relevant signal to
subtract a one from the next upper byte. The down-count cycle
ends when all three bytes are 0xFF, so there is one additional
cycle absolved, as compared with a zero recognition. This extra
cycle is subtracted from <b>c</b> when the loop is starting.
<br><br>
Note that toggling a pin's output portbit by setting its PIN
bit high is not implemented in older AVR devices, but ATtiny13
and many others have that implemented.

<h2>Calculating the loop's delay</h2>
Another method to calculate loop delays is to list the instructions
and to evaluate how often these are executed within the complete
loop. The table demonstrates that.
<br><br>
<img src="avr-asm-tutorial-delay_24bit_loop_subi_calc.gif" width="941" height="541" align="RIGHT" alt="Caclulating clock cycles">
The list's source line column lists all instructions that the loop
consists of. The next column describes how often the instruction is
executed within the loops, depending from the constant <b>c</b>.
For all conditional branches in the loop two numbers have to be
considered: the number of cases where jumps occur (those need two
clock cycles each) and where no jumps occur (consuming only one
clock cycle). The single clock cycle instructions are written to
the next column, the two-cycle instructions are listed in the
following column, already multiplied by two. The third column adds
the two previous columns and sorts the formula's constituents by
their type.
<br><br>
Note that the division by 256 and by 65,536 are in integer math:
only the full number as integer is used, the fractions are deleted
and neither considered nor used to round up.
<br><br>
The complete formula for the clock cycles can easily be derived
then by summing up the different constituents.
<br clear="ALL">

<h2>Calculating c for a certain number of clock cycles</h2>
The formula to calculate <b>c</b> for a number of clock cycles CC
is rather simple:<br>
<center>c = (CC - 7) / (3 + 2 / 256 + 2 / 65536) = (CC - 7) / 3.00784301757812</center>
or roughly divided by 3.
<br><br>
If you want to calculate this exactly in an assembler source file,
you'll have to ensure that the small fraction at the end is correct.
So multiply both, the divident and the divisor, with a large enough
number - e.g. 0x100000000 - first, before dividing 2 by 256 and 2 by
65536. The exact formulation then is:
<pre>
<code>
.equ cM=0x100000000
.equ cCalc =(cM*(cc-7))/(3*cM+2*cM/256+2*cM/65536)
</code>
</pre>
That ensures that the derived number for <b>c</b> is absolutely correct.

<h2>64 bit loop</h2>
For extremely long times, such as hours, days and years more than only
24 bits are necessary. The same algorithm works here, but with 64 bits
delays of up to 730,000 years can be handled.
<br><br>
The counting loop with 64 bits looks like that:
<pre>
<code>
Restart:
  ldi rCnt0,Byte1(cCnt) ; +1 = 1
  ldi rCnt1,Byte2(cCnt) ; +1 = 2
  ldi rCnt2,Byte3(cCnt) ; +1 = 3
  ldi rCnt3,Byte4(cCnt) ; +1 = 4
  ldi rCnt4,Byte1(cCnt/65536/65536) ; +1 = 5
  ldi rCnt5,Byte2(cCnt/65536/65536) ; +1 = 6
  ldi rCnt6,Byte3(cCnt/65536/65536) ; +1 = 7
  ldi rCnt7,Byte4(cCnt/65536/65536) ; +1 = 8
Count:
  subi rCnt0,1 ; Downcount rCnt0
  brcc Count ; First inner loop
  subi rCnt1,1 ; Downcount rCnt1
  brcc Count ; First outer loop
  subi rCnt2,1 ; Downcount rCnt2
  brcc Count ; Second outer loop
  subi rCnt3,1 ; Downcount rCnt3
  brcc Count ; Third outer loop
  subi rCnt4,1 ; Downcount rCnt4
  brcc Count ; Fourth outer loop
  subi rCnt5,1 ; Downcount rCnt5
  brcc Count ; Fifth outer loop
  subi rCnt6,1 ; Downcount rCnt6
  brcc Count ; Sixth outer loop
  subi rCnt7,1 ; Downcount rCnt7
  brcc Count ; Seventh outer loop
  sbi pIn,bIn ; Ignite, +2 = 10
  rjmp Restart ; Restart, +2 = 12
</code>
</pre>
The calculation is also relative simple. The inner loop in the
loop section is executed cCnt times plus one. Each execution
consumes three clock cyles (one for SUBI, two for the BRCC).
The last execution needs only two clock cycles because the
jump back is not executed. The BRCC of the inner loop is
therefore executed
<ul>
  <li>&quot;cCnt - cCnt / 256 + 1&quot; with two clock cycles,
    plus</li>
  <li>&quot;cCnt / 256 + 1&quot; with one clock cycle</li>
  </ul>
The two &quot;+1&quot; are caused by the fact that all loops
are executed at least once and that the counter count down to
0xFFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF and not to zero.
<br><br>
The next loop is executed &quot;(c / 256) + 1&quot; times, the
following loops each 256 times less. This yields the following
row:
<br><br>
<table border=2>
<tr><th>Loop</th><th>Executions</th><th>Abbreviation</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>cCnt + 1</td><td>c + 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>cCnt / 256 + 1</td><td>c8</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>cCnt / 65,536 + 1</td><td>c16</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>cCnt / 16,777,216 + 1</td><td>c24</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>cCnt / 4,294,967,296 + 1</td><td>c32</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>cCnt / 1,099,511,627,776 + 1</td><td>c40</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>cCnt / 281,474,976,710,656 + 1</td><td>c48</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>cCnt / 72,057,594,037,927,936 + 1</td><td>c56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Last</td><td>cCnt / 18,446,744,072,719,551,616 + 1</td><td>c64</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
Please note that the divisions are in integer mode with decimal fraction
ignored (rounded down).
<br><br>
This yields the following rows of clock cycles.
<br><br>
<table border=2>

<tr><td>rjmp Restart</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
If all instruction cycles are added together, the following formula
describes the total clock cycles:
<br>
<center>CC = 3*c + 2*c8 + 2*c16 + 2*c24 + 2*c32 + 2*c40 + 2*c48 + 2*c56 - c64 + 13</center>
The c is approximately CC / 3 (with an error smaller than 1%), but
it can be calculated exactly with this formula.
<br><br>
Because the conversion of e.g. years in clock cycles is not that
simple, I added the following lines to the code:
<pre>
<code>
; **********************************
;   A D J U S T A B L E   C O N S T
; **********************************
;
; Compose the duration of counting
.equ cCntYears = 0
.equ cCntMonthes = 0
.equ cCntDays = 0
.equ cCntHours = 0
.equ cCntMinutes = 0
.equ cCntSeconds = 0
.equ cCntMilliseconds = 100
.equ cCntMicroseconds = 0
;
; The clock frequency
.equ Clock = 1200000 ; of the ATtiny13
;
; **********************************
;  F I X  &  D E R I V.  C O N S T
; **********************************
;
.equ cCntSec = cCntSeconds+60*cCntMinutes+3600*cCntHours+86400*cCntDays+2629800*cCntMonthes+31557600*cCntYears
.equ cCntUSec = 1000*cCntMilliseconds+cCntMicroSeconds
.equ cCnt = (cCntSec * Clock + Clock * cCntUSec / 1000000 - 70) / 3
</code>
</pre> 
Editing times is comfortable with this, the assembler does all the
conversion work. If you want to have the first pulse one hour after
the operation voltage has been applied, just set cCntHours to one.
<br><br>
The code of the 64-bit-looping is <a href="Time64.asm">here</a>.
<br><br>
You see that optimization in assembler provides many opportunities.
Here we just replaced a DEC with a SUBI instruction and a BRNE by
a BRCC instruction, and we got a short and simple piece of code.
And: easy to understand and to calculate.
<br><br>
But: please note that the calculation of very long time periods
can exceed the limits of assemblers that only work with 32 bit
long integers. Assembling then ends with an overflow message.
gavrasm and avr_sim work with INT64 and you can handle 1000s
of years long time loops without any problems.

<h2>Modified 64-bit delay</h2>
The rather complicated calculation of the delay time can be
simplified by adding an NOP at the end of each counting loop,
to bring all 256 counter loop executions to the same clock
cycle lengthes. Such a counter loop now looks like this:
<pre>
<code>
  ldi rCnt,LoopRepetitions
Counterloop:
  subi rCnt,1
  brcc Counterloop
  nop
</code>
</pre>
Each loop execution now needs exactly 3 clock cycles. If you
combine eight of such loops, each addional loop executions needs
three clock cycles. The number of clock cycles is then:<br>
<center>CC = 3 * cCnt / 256<sup>0</sup> + 3 * cCnt / 256<sup>1</sup> + 3 * cCnt / 256<sup>2</sup> + 3 * cCnt / 256<sup>3</sup> + ... + 3 * cCnt / 256<sup>7</sup> + 36</center>
Each <b>cCnt/256<sup>N</sup></b> stands for another execution of
the byte loop N. The constant <b>36</b> stands for the loading
time, the execution of all the loops in the last cycle and for
switching and for the jumping back.
<br><br>
This can be coded in assembler much simpler than in the upper case.
The sourec code <a href="Time64nop.asm">here</a> does this and
demonstrates such a counting loop. Additionally this source code
allows the calculation of very long times (&gt; 10 years) to be
compatible with a 64-bit integer handling. But: calculation of
256<sup>7</sup> still fails, so that the algorithm produces a small
error margin in times longer than 1,000 years, which introduces
additional problems with battery sustainability either way.
