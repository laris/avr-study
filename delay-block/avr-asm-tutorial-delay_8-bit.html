<h1>Timing loop with an 8 bit register in AVR assembler</h1>
Here the most simple time delay loop in one 8 bit register. Even though this only provides
very short delays, it is useful to understand it because it provides the basic knowledge
to step to other, more useful but also more complicated solutions. Calculating times,
executed instructions etc. have to be learned here.
<br clear="ALL">

<h2>Coding an 8 bit loop in assembler</h2>
In assembler, such an 8 bit delay loop looks like that:
<pre>
<code>
.equ c1 = 200 ; Define number of loop executions as a constant
	ldi R16,c1 ; Instruction: load a register with this constant
Loop: ; Loop starts
	dec R16 ; Instruction: Decrease register value by one, if zero set Z flag in SREG
	brne Loop ; Instruction: if not zero jump to label Loop:, otherwise continue, uses Z in SREG
</pre>
</code>
Practically the constant c1 determines the number of loop executions. As an 8 bit
register can only hold 256 different numbers, the resolution is rather limited.

<h2>Controller clocks</h2>
The time that the controller needs to go through this delay loop is depending from
two basic things:
<ul>
  <li>the number of clock cycles that each executed instruction requires (obviously
    more than the three that the loop consists of, because of the repetitions),</li>
  <li>the time that each clock cycle requires.</li>
  </ul>
The number of clock cycles that are needed for each instruction are listed in the
data books of the AVRs, close to the book's end in a chapter called &quot;Instruction
Set Summary&quot;, in the column &quot;"#Clocks&quot;. According to this our delay
loop instructions need the following number of clock cycles:
<pre>
<code>
.equ c1 = 200 ; No instruction, no clock cycles, solely for the assembler
	ldi R16,c1 ; 1 clock cycle
Loop: ; Loop start
	dec R16 ; 1 clock cycle
	brne Loop ; 2 clock cycles when zero flag is clear, 1 clock cycle when zero flag is set
</pre>
</code>
The number of clock cycles therefore is:
<ol>
  <li>Loading: 1 cycle, executed only once, plus</li>
  <li>Loop: 1 + 2 = 3 cycles when jumping back, plus</li>
  <li>Loop end: 1 + 1 = 2 cycles when not jumping back at the last loop execution.</li>
  </ol>
The number of clock cycles for the loop therefore is<br>
<center>n<sub>cycles</sub> = 1 + 3 * (c1 - 1) + 2</center><br>
When multiplying the bracket by 3 the following results:<br>
<center>n<sub>cycles</sub> = 1 + 3 * c1 - 3 + 2</center><br>
or even simpler:<br>
<center>n<sub>cycles</sub> = 3 * c1</center><br>
For our above formulation with c1 = 200 the number of clock cycles is 3 * 200 = 600.
<br><br>
A special situation occurs, if we set c1 to 0: when the DEC instruction is first executed,
the register &quot;underflows&quot; and reaches 255. As this does not set the Z flag in
the status register SREG, the loop further executes normal. In that case the loop executes
256 times until the decreased register reaches zero again. So the maximum delay with
an 8 bit register is 256 * 3 = 768 clock cycles.

<h2>Clock frequency of the AVR</h2>
The duration for each clock cycle is 1 divided by the clock frequency of the AVR.
At 1 MHz that is 1 / 1,000,000 = 0.000,001&nbsp;seconds or 1 &micro;s.
<br><br>
It isn't that simple to find out at which clock frequency the AVR works as there
are many opportunities to manipulate that:
<ol>
  <li>As shipped: with the internal RC oscillator:
    <ul>
      <li>without the CLKDIV8 fuse set: 8 MHz (ATtiny13: 9.6 MHz),</li>
      <li>default: with the CLKDIV8 fuse set: internal RC oscillator divided by 8,</li>
      <li>the frequency of the internal RC oscillator can be modified in certain
        limits by writing values to the OSCCAL port by overwriting the default
        content in this port,</li>        
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Modified clock sources, selected by fuse settings:
    <ul>
      <li>another internal RC oscillator (e.g. 128 kHz in an ATtiny13), or</li>
      <li>an external clock (RC oscillator, a crystal oscillator) supplied to
        the CLOCK1/XTAL1 input pin, or</li>
      <li>an external crystal or resonator on XTAL1 and XTAL2, oscillated with
        an internal inverter stage.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>The external or internal oscillator signal can be divided by
    <ul>
      <li>8 by setting the CLKDIV8 fuse, or</li>
      <li>by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 by writing to the CLKPR port, either
        on startup only or on the fly at any time by the software.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
If unmodified you'll find the default clock in the data book in the chapter
&quot;System Clock and Clock Options&quot; resp. in the sub-chapter
&quot;Default Clock Source&quot;.

<h2>Time delay</h2>
With the number of clock cycles n<sub>cycles</sub> and the the clock frequency
the time delay by the 8 bit loop is<br>
<center>t<sub>delay</sub>[seconds] = n<sub>cycles</sub> / f<sub>clock</sub>[Hz]</center><br>
So, with an ATtiny13 and its default settings (f<sub>clock</sub> = 1.2 MHz) the
range of time delays is between 3*1/1,200,000 (= 2.5&micro;s) and 3*256/1,200,000
(= 640&micro;s). If you have set CLKPR to a divide by a higher rate (e.g. 128
instead of the default 8) the delays are by a factor of 128 / 8 = 16-fold longer,
roughly 10ms max.

<h2>Extending delay</h2>
With the following formulation some further delay can be reached:
<pre>
<code>
.equ c1 = 200 ; 0 cycles, solely executed by the assembler
	ldi R16,c1 ; 1 cycle
Loop: ; Loop start
	nop ; do nothing, 1 cycle
	nop ; do nothing, 1 cycle
	nop ; do nothing, 1 cycle
	nop ; do nothing, 1 cycle
	nop ; do nothing, 1 cycle
	dec R16 ; 1 cycle
	brne Loop ; 2 cycles if not zero, 1 cycle when zero
</pre>
</code>
Now each loop cycle (except for the last one) needs eight clock cycles and the formula
changes to<br>
<center>n<sub>cycles</sub> = 1 + 8 * (c1 - 1) + 7 = 8 * c1</center><br>
This prolongs the delay by a factor of 8 / 3 = 2.667. But still not enough delay for
blinking, but enough for a tone generation program.

<h2>The tone generator program</h2>
<img src="speaker.gif" width="210" height="156" align="LEFT" alt="Speaker on port pin PB0">
With our c1 of 200, we can produce a tone of 586&nbsp;Hz in an attached speaker. To avoid
too high DC currents, we use an electrolytical capacitor in between. If you assemble the
following source code and burn its hex into an ATtiny13's flash memory, you'll get that
tone.
<br clear="ALL">
<pre>
<code>
.nolist ; Switch listing off
.include "tn13def.inc" ; assembles for an ATtiny13
.list
.equ c1 = 0 ; Defines the tone height (factually is 256!)
	sbi DDRB,0 ; Port bit as output
Loop:
	sbi PORTB,0 ; Port bit output to high
	ldi R16,c1 ; Load constant
Loop1:
	nop
	nop
	nop
	nop
	nop
	dec R16
	brne Loop1
	cbi PORTB,0 ; Portbit to low
	ldi R16,c1
Loop2:
	nop
	nop
	nop
	nop
	nop
	dec R16
	brne Loop2
	rjmp Loop
</pre>
</code>

That is the program in the simulator
<a href="http://www.avr-asm-tutorial.net/avr_sim/index_en.html">avr_sim</a>. It produces a
nice rectangle with 50% pulse width and a frequency of 292.54&nbsp;Hz. As we delay by 256
loop cycles, this is the lowest we can get.
<br><br>
For those who need to generate other frequencies, here is the formula. The number of cycles
here is the sum from
<ol>
  <li>two cycles for the SBI,</li>
  <li>the first loop with 8 * c1 cycles,</li>
  <li>two cycles for the CBI,</li>
  <li>the second loop with 8 * c1 cycles,</li>
  <li>two cycles for the RJMP.</li>
  </ol>
And<br>
<center>n<sub>cycles</sub> = 2 + 8 * c1 + 2 + 8 * c1 + 2 = 16 * c1 + 6 = 4,102</center><br>
The time delay of the whole loop is<br>
<center>t<sub>loop</sub> = 4,102 / 1,200,000 = 3.4183 ms</center><br>
And for the frequency,<br>
<center>f<sub>tone</sub> = 1,000 / 3.4183 = 292.54 Hz</center><br>
Exactly as simulated.
<br clear="ALL"><br>
If you need c1 for a certain frequency the formula is:<br>
<center>t<sub>loop</sub> [seconds] = 1 / f<sub>tone</sub>[Hz]<br>
t<sub>loop</sub>[seconds] = n<sub>cycles</sub> / f<sub>clock</sub>[Hz]<br>
n<sub>cycles</sub> = t<sub>loop</sub>[seconds] * f<sub>clock</sub>[Hz]<br>
n<sub>cycles</sub> = 16 * c1 + 6<br>
c1 = (n<sub>cycles</sub> - 6) / 16<br>
c1 = (t<sub>loop</sub>[seconds] * f<sub>clock</sub>[Hz] - 6) / 16<br>
c1 = (1 / f<sub>tone</sub>[Hz] * f<sub>clock</sub>[Hz] - 6) / 16<br>
c1 = (f<sub>clock</sub> / f<sub>tone</sub> - 6) / 16</center><br>
So, if you need 440&nbsp;Hz (chamber tone A), you'll have to set c1 to
170. If you need 2&nbsp;kHz, set it to 37 (produces exactly 2006.7&nbsp;Hz).
<br><br>
If you need higher frequency of more accuracy, either
<ul>
  <li>remove the NOPs from the loop,</li>
  <li>clear the CLKDIV8 fuse, and/or</li>
  <li>write a smaller clock divider value to CLKPR, and/or</li>
  <li>use a higher clock frequency.</li>
  </ul>
<br><br> 
If you need lower frequencies than 294&nbsp;Hz: either
<ul>
  <li>increase the number of NOPs inserted, and/or</li>
  <li>increase the clock divider rate in CLKPR, and/or</li>
  <li>use a lower frequency RC oscillator internally, and/or</li>
  <li>supply a lower external clock.</li>
  </ul>
You see: lots of options to tailor those to your needs.
<br><br>
Remember: this is exact as long as the controller does nothing else than
counting loops (and as exact its clock frequency is). But: it is by far
more exact if programmed in assembler (because the controller does nothing
else and is fully under your complete control) than in any other language
or control structure.
